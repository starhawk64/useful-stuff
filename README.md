# useful-stuff

This is a holding-tank, an archive, for various miscellaneous (and very likely largely-unsorted) things I find useful. Do not expect (or rely on) the assumed permanence of a given item. As with life, and all other things within, the existence of files, documents, etc within this archive is ephemeral. Nothing is forever (except perhaps Google, and change/entropy).

Anyone can retrieve files from this archive (which is effectively what it is) for any purpose, except as restricted by the laws and regulations that apply to them. However, individual files uploaded here may or may not have their applicable licensing information accompanying them, and it is up to the downloader(s) and/or eventual user(s) of such files to determine both what license(s) apply to any given specific file they use from here, and whether or not their use is in compliance with said license(s) -- along with, of course, whether or not they care.

I take absolutely no responsibility for any such actions except my own -- what you do is your business, under your authority, and you are responsible for it -- none of that is mine, in any way, nor should it be. If you cannot accept responsibility for your own actions, you should delegate them -- and the corresponding authority -- to someone else who can. In any case, I neither need nor want to know about it.

Having said that... take care, and do something nice, kind, and thoughtful for someone you care about today. The world could use more of that!
